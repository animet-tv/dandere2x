Original Author: aka_katto 
Purpose: This class / thread is responsible for turning 'residual' 
         images into complete images by using the upscaled images
         and previous frames.
         
         An added responsibility of this class is to directly save
         the finished images into a 'finished' (no audio migrations)
         video, which is done by using the pipe class to pipe frames
         into ffmpeg. 
         
Comments / Notes: This is probably the most difficult to understand
                  dandere2x method due to it's overloaded nature, 
                  since it needs to do the most heavy lifting in 
                  dandere2x as well as needing to deal with the most
                  optimizations. I highly recommend having 
                  `make_merge_image` open when trying to underfirestand 
                  this method to supplement the confusing nature

          as signalling to other parts of Dandere2x we've finished upscaling.
